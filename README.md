# crowbook-localize

A library to localize strings, translating them according to runtime options.

Basically, this library allows your project to generate a `lformat!` macro, that behaves
similarly to `format!`, except the message string (the first argument) might get translated
(if you can find the appropriate string for the language).

## Usage

First, you'll need to add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
build = "build.rs"

[build-dependencies]
crowbook-localize = "0.0.8"

[dependencies]
lazy_static = "0.2" # the generated file needs `lazy_static!`
```

You'll then need to create the `build.rs` file, which can look like this:

```rust
extern crate crowbook_localize;
use crowbook_localize::{Localizer, Extractor};

fn main() {
    // Generate a `lang/default.pot` containing strings used to call `lformat!`
    let mut extractor = Extractor::new();
    extractor.add_messages_from_dir(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/src")).unwrap();
    extractor.write_pot_file(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/lang/default.pot")).unwrap();

    // Generate the `localize_macros.rs` file
    let mut localizer = Localizer::new(&extractor);
    localizer.write_macro_file(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/src/lib/localize_macros.rs")).unwrap();
}
```

This way, a `localize_macros.rs` file will be created at build time in `src/lib`.
To use it, the last step is to modify your `src/lib/lib.rs` file:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;
#[macro_use] mod localize_macros;
```

Once this is done, you can start replacing your calls to `format!` with calls to `lformat!`.

In order to get translation, you'll need to actually translate the strings in separate
files, and set your `build.rs` to load them.

E.g., if you have the following code:

```rust
println!("{}", lformat!("Hello, world!"));
```
and you want it translated in french, you'll have to create a `lang/fr.po` file
from the `lang/default.pot` file containing:

```text
msgid "Hello, world!";
msgstr "Bonjour le monde !";
```

And load it in your `build.rs` file:

```rust
let mut localizer = Localizer::new();
localizer.add_lang("fr", include_str!(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/lang/fr.mp"))).unwrap();
localizer.write_macro_file("...");
```

Once *this* is done, you can use the `localize_macros::set_lang` function
to switch the language at runtime:

```rust
use localize_macros::set_lang;
set_lang("en");
println!("{}", lformat!("Hello, world!")); // prints "Hello, world!"
set_lang("fr");
println!("{}", lformat!("Hello, world!")); // prints "Bonjour le monde !"
```

## Updating your translation

When you add new strings that need to be translated (by more calls to `lformat!`),
or when you change the content of existing strings, you can use [Gettext's `msgmerge`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/msgmerge-Invocation.html)
command to update your translation. While it is not guaranteed that the formats are
strictly identicals, it should work. (That is, it is a bug if it doesn't; but at this
stage, this library is absolutely not guaranteed to be bug-free.)

## Warning

In case the complexity of the operation didn't discourage you, I should warn you
that this library is highly experimental at this time.
